## About Me

My name is Christian Horta, I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for technology and computers, looking to bring my part to the development world. During my time at FIU, I took software development, database management, and data structures. I found that one of my strengths is my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment. I believe that communication, empathy, and a positive attitude are essential to working as a team. I am also a quick learner and enjoy taking on new challenges.
